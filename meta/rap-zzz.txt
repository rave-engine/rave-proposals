Abstract
========
This document forms a template for any new Rave Architectural Proposal (RAPs).

Contents
========

Rationale
---------
To help users new to RAPs format their RAP properly, a template where writers
can just fill in their proposal details would provide a valuable resource.
This prevents writers from having to figure out the except formatting details
on their own, and can potentially harmonize new RAPs more by ensuring formatting
homogeny.

Implementation
---------------
This template is implemented as a meta-RAP, to be assigned the ID RAP-ZZZ.

Potential issues
----------------
Misformatting of this document would cause newly submitted RAPs by writers who
followed it to be badly formatted too: it would have a cascading effect.
That is why this document would have to be kept up-to-date at all times with
the current proposal guidelines.

Due to the mixing of placeholder content (see metadata at the top) and actual
content (see this section), writers could be confused. However, by having them
read this very section the authors hope to clear up this confusion and state it
should all be replaced with the actual proposal content, and that the initial
status is 'DRAFT'. See also RAP-B[1].

Alternative solutions
---------------------
An alternative suggestion would be to write a full style guide for RAPs.
While arguably more effective, this can confuse new writers and potentially
put them off writing RAPs due its sheer required size. It would also be likely
far more text-oriented and less visual, leading to potential confusion.

The authors believe a template is a simpler and thus more effective solution.

Conclusion
----------
The authors believe a simple template like this document will provide an
effective tool for new writers to format their RAP.
